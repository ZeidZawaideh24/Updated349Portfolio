        Helped develop a Machine Learning Parser using LAF (Log Analysis Framework) to analyze and 
        track network traffic for the 5G-Data subsystem. (1) Processes log entries extracting, computing, and storing 
        results in table(s) for further analysis. (2) Parser detects the accuracy of flows for Gaming, OTT, and nRT regarding KPI 
        latency performance. (3) Validated Gaming Automation Enhancements for multiple applications to ensure proper testing accuracy. 
        (4) Scripted OTT Automation for Microsoft Teams Application: The Primary Device opens The application finds the desired contact 
        and makes the call. The Secondary Device will answer, and the call will last for the desired time needed.

      <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Key Performance Indicators</li>
        <li>Data Structures</li>
        <li>5G LTE</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Project Outcome:</h2>
      <p>
        The high-level goal is to run the two automations while using the Parser to investigate the network traffic and accuracy of the KPI 
        Latency performance for the application(s) in use.
