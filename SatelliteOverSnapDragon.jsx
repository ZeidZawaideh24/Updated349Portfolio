        Using software development skills, investigated developing a mechanism incorporating end-to-end testing by 
        looking into any delays and issues between the middleware and application layer. The automation allows checking 
        within the application and middleware regarding functional and performance issues. Test cases were initiated via 
        automation from the application level to middleware and data demon. While traversing the automation will find issues, 
        whether functional or performance.
